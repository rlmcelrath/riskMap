# Interview Project - Rebecca McElrath

## Used the angular2-mapboxgl-starter scaffolding to start building architecture

I chose to use the angular2-mapboxgl-starter kit to begin. Wanted to incorporate Angular.io (Angular2) and MapboxGl. I chose Angular.io because even though I haven't used Angular 2 yet I'm most familar with Angular 1 and Typescript so I thought it would be the best framework for me to use for this project. I chose MapboxGL because it is the new map api from Mapbox and I thought it would be fun to try and implement. 

The original project is a minimal project seed of Angular2, Webpack, and MapboxGL. 

I reorganized the file structure to be more feature based, the format I like to work in.

See [**live demo**](https://haoliangyu.github.io/angular2-mapboxgl-starter/) for the original application.

Working with [Angular 2 official release](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#200-2016-09-14)!

## How to set up

I did not change the build much other than to add a couple libraries. The install should be pretty much the same. 

This project requires [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)) and [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/docs/installation.html).

1.	Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install all dependencies.

2.	Run `webpack` to build the project.

3.	As a more convinient way, install and run the [webpack-dev-server](http://webpack.github.io/docs/installation.html) to set up the app at `http://localhost:8080`

4. I used "webpack-dev-server --progress --colors" to build and watch for changes as I was writing code.
